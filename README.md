# News Website
Hello, welcome to my latest Vue project. This time I thought about an API integration. After a bit of research, I decided on a news API provided by newsapi.org. 

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```
